## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Create your environment file:

```bash
copy .env.example .env
```

Update `.env` with your Supabase PostgreSQL connection:

```text
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:<YOUR-SUPABASE-PASSWORD>@db.nqrfskmrepojqmurjrvo.supabase.co:5432/postgres?sslmode=no-verify
JWT_SECRET=replace-this-with-a-long-random-secret
DB_SSL_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=false
CLIENT_ORIGIN=https://web-project-courseflow.vercel.app
```

For the React frontend, set this in `frontend/.env` or in Vercel environment variables:

```text
VITE_API_URL=https://web-project-yj6g.onrender.com/api
```

You can also connect with `psql`:

```bash
psql -h db.nqrfskmrepojqmurjrvo.supabase.co -p 5432 -d postgres -U postgres
```

Or use the helper script:

```bash
npm run db:psql:supabase
```

Create and seed the Supabase database:

```bash
npm run db:schema
npm run db:seed
```

Run the full app:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Platform Tutorial

Welcome to CourseFlow! Here is a full tutorial on how to use the platform across its three main roles: Student, Instructor, and Admin.

### 1. Student Experience
- **Registration:** Anyone can visit the site and create an account. By default, new accounts are created as Students.
- **Browsing:** Students can explore the "Marketplace" to see all approved courses. They can use the search bar, category filters, and sorting options to find the perfect course.
- **Enrolling & Payment:** When a student finds a course they want, they click "Enroll". A payment modal will appear with instructions to manually send the course fee (in PKR) via NayaPay to the provided account details. After confirming, the enrollment goes into a "Payment Pending Approval" state.
- **My Learning:** Students can track their approved enrollments in the "My Learning" dashboard, where they can mark lessons as complete and track their overall progress.

### 2. Instructor Experience
- **Account Creation:** Instructors cannot register themselves. They must be invited and created by an Admin from the Admin Panel.
- **Course Creation:** Once logged in, Instructors can create new courses via their dashboard. They fill out course details, including title, category, description, and price (in PKR). 
- **Approval Workflow:** Newly created courses are marked as "Pending" and are not visible in the public marketplace until an Admin reviews and approves them.
- **Student Roster:** Instructors can view a list of all students enrolled in their active courses and track their learning progress.

### 3. Admin Experience
- **User Management:** Admins have full access to manage all users on the platform. They can view the user list, change roles, or suspend active accounts.
- **Course Moderation:** Admins review "Pending" courses submitted by instructors. They can "Approve" them to go live in the marketplace or "Deny" them.
- **Payment Approvals:** When a student confirms a NayaPay manual payment, the request appears in the "Payment Approvals" queue on the Admin Panel. The admin verifies the NayaPay transaction and clicks "Approve" to grant the student access to the course content, or "Deny" if the payment was not received (which removes the enrollment request).
